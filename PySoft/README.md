### PySoft
Welcome to `Software`'s PySoft section, where I will be storing all of my and some of Okmeque1's Python codes and programs.

Some of these codes contains modules that have to be installed. Please check the ["Programs.md" file](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) for informations about programs requiring those modules. To install these modules, the best solution is to go to [Pypa's PIP repository](https://github.com/pypa/pip) and follow the instructions on how to install PIP, if you don't have it on your PC.
After you have PIP installed, go to your PC's Command Prompt (CMD) and type `pip install` + the module's name. *Example:* `pip install pygame`.
