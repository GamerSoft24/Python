### PySoft:
Welcome to `Software`'s PySoft section, where I will be storing all of my and some of Okmeque1's Python codes and programs.

But, some of these codes contains modules that have to be installed. Please check the ["Programs.md" file](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) for informations about programs requiring those modules. To install these modules, the best solution is to go to [Pipa's PIP repository](https://github.com/pypa/pip) and follow the instructions to install PIP, if you don't have it on your PC.
