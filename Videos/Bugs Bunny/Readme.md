# Bugs Bunny Video Section

## Copyrights

These videos are from *my (Okemque`10)* collection of Bugs Bunny, and are the recovery of a lost hard disk at a hotel, one of the only few that I managed to save before it was ultimately lost.

## What is which?

Some episodes have the name in it, such as 'BB24 Rhapsody Rabbit.AVI', but some others you'll have to guess, such as 'BB31 01.AVI'. Note that to be able to view the videos properly, you need VLC Media player.

## Why is there nothing here?

That's because most of the videos are in a *.AVI format, which is not space-efficient. Unfortunately, these are the best quality videos we have, and converting them will have a significant loss in quality. Thank you for your understanding.
