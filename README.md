## VBSoft:
This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** VBS (Windows Visual Basic Script) codes.

***WARNING!*** The VBS codes are *more towards **pranks** and **"unharmful"** viruses.* Be careful though as the `/VBSoft/Deadly` folder, the codes there are actually ***really deadly*** and can *crash you RAM* in just a **few seconds running.**

## HTMLSoft:

This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** HTML (HyperText Markup Language) codes.

## CPPSoft:

This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** C & C++ codes although it's name is CPPSoft (C++ Software).

The codes will be more *focused* on **C++** rather then **C** and also there will be lots of codes working with external devices, like NodeMCU boards.

It is recommended to have Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) istalled on your PC as a lot of programs will require it. Please check the "Programs.md" (https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file for informations about programs requiring Arduino IDE.
