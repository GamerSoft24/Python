## CPPSoft:

This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** C & C++ codes and programs although it's name is CPPSoft (C++ Software).

The codes will be more *focused* on **C++** rather then **C** and also there will be lots of codes working with external devices, like NodeMCU boards.

It is recommended to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) istalled on your PC as a lot of programs will require it. Please check the ["Programs.md"](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file for informations about programs requiring Arduino IDE.
